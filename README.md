Author: Wesley Ng

Want to know how much money you can gain from investing into compound interest? Well, now you can
through this app!

This webapp allows users to calculate their potential compound interest over time after investing
a certain amount of money before compounding.

## How To Use

This webapp uses two different equations to calculate your investments: the general compound
interest formula (A=P(1+r/n)^(nt)) or the cotinuous compound interest formula (A=Pe^(rt)).
These are automatically selected when you use the app.

To use the following webapp to calculate your potential investments, make sure you input each of the
following variables:

- Principal Amount (P) - Your initial investments before compounding.
- Annual Interest Rate (r) - Uses a slider between 0.0%-10.0% Match the rate to the interest rate when you invested.
- Number of Periods (n) - The amount of times your money grows in the year. For example, if you chose to compound quarterly, then your investments compound four times in the year.
- Time in Years (t) - The amount of years your investments will be compounding.
